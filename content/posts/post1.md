**Notes, projects, and photos—quietly opinionated from my corner of the internet.**

I wiped my machine, rebuilt the dev setup, and decided this was the perfect time to start fresh here. This site is a place to collect the things I’m building and learning without the noise.
I’ve tried Medium and Substack, but they felt too noisy with endless “how I made a fortune with five tricks” posts. It made me miss the old internet, when there were no algorithms and stumbling onto a blog felt like discovery. That’s what I’m going for here. You’ll find projects and tools I’m working on, links to my photos from travels and the outdoors, and the occasional personal essay about who knows what.. A little bit of everything. I doubt many folks will read this; it’s primarily for me. An outlet to fill a creativity void I’ve been feeling.

## How this site works
Built with **Hugo** + **PaperMod**, deployed via **GitHub Actions** to **GitHub Pages**. Fast, minimal, version-controlled.

- RSS is available at `/index.xml`.
- Source and issues live on GitHub

Thanks for reading
